# QRNG
This repo is about Quantum Random Number Generator.
Welcome to my QRNG project, crafted with love and a bit of quantum magic for the Amaravati Quantum Valley Hackathon 2025! ðŸŒŒðŸš€ This repository houses a Quantum Random Number Generator built using Qiskit, designed to produce truly random bits for cryptographic purposes. Letâ€™s dive into the adventure!
What I Built
Iâ€™ve created a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) using the Qiskit library, a powerful tool for quantum computing. The heart of this project is an 8-qubit quantum circuit where I applied Hadamard gates to throw each qubit into superpositionâ€”a state of pure quantum uncertainty. When measured, these qubits collapse into either 0 or 1 with equal probability, generating around 255 unique 8-bit strings. I saved these random treasures in a random_bits.txt file, ready to spark some cryptographic creativity! The process was a thrilling mix of coding, debugging, and marveling at quantum weirdness.
How It Works
The magic happens in the quantum realm! Hereâ€™s the gist:

I set up an 8-qubit circuit and used Hadamard gates to create superposition, making each qubit a blend of 0 and 1 until measured.
Running this on Qiskitâ€™s AerSimulator with 100 to 1000 shots, I collected the resulting bitstrings, with the final 1000-shot run yielding my random dataset.
The randomness comes from quantum mechanicsâ€™ inherent unpredictabilityâ€”unlike classical pseudo-random number generators, this is true randomness straight from the quantum world!

I also whipped up some cool visualizations using Matplotlib:

A circuit diagram to show the setup.
A histogram of bitstring frequencies.
A Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of those frequencies.
A plot tracking how entropy grows with more shots.

The Role of Entropy
Entropy is the star of the show hereâ€”it measures the randomness and unpredictability of my bitstrings, which is crucial for cryptography. I calculated two types:

Shannon Entropy: This tells us the average information content. For my 1000-shot run, it hovered around 7.9 bits (out of a max 8 bits), showing the bits are pretty darn random!
Min-Entropy: This focuses on the worst-case predictability, coming in at about 6.9 bits. It reflects the highest probability of any single outcome, and a higher value means better randomness.

These entropy metrics prove my QRNG produces high-quality random numbers, making it a solid foundation for secure applications. The more shots I used, the better the entropy gotâ€”proof that quantum scaling pays off!
Cryptographic Applications
These random bits arenâ€™t just for showâ€”theyâ€™re a goldmine for cryptography! I took the 255 bitstrings, combined the first 32 into a 256-bit sequence, and hashed it with SHA-256 to create a superkey. Using this key, I encrypted a sample text (e.g., "Hello") by converting it to binary, XORing it with a key stream derived from the superkey, and decrypted it backâ€”successfully! This unpredictability makes quantum random numbers ideal for:

Generating secure encryption keys that hackers canâ€™t predict.
Enhancing data protection in fields like finance, defense, and healthcare.
Building future quantum-safe cryptographic systems as quantum computers grow.

Itâ€™s a small step, but itâ€™s opened my eyes to the power of quantum randomness in security!
